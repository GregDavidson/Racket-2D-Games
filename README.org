* 2D Multi-Player Network Games Framework in Racket

** TL;dr

A Client/Server Framework
- written in :: the Racket Programming Language and Platform
- for :: building 2D Multi-User Games

** Terminology

- World Client
      - A Game Application run by a User to play the game
      - Connects as a Client to a Universe Server for that game
      - Manages interactive input and output for that User

- Universe Server
      - Runs somewhere on the Internet
      - Gives each World Client a unique World ID on connection
      - Coordinates the World Clients
      - by relaying Messages among them

** Based On

Currently based on Racket packages
- 2htdp/universe
- 2htdp/images

** Features

- 2D Sprites
- Simple Serialization Framework
      - 2htdp/universe doesn't understand Racket Serialization

** Used By

- Computing-Magic/Modules/Module-1c/Network-Volley
- Learner-Gits/Eti/Multiplayer-Flightlander/

** Files

- [[file:sprites-framework.rkt][sprites-framework.rkt]] - sprites, serialization, worlds, messages
- [[file:sprites-client-framework.rkt][sprites-client-framework.rkt]] - updates sprites of all worlds
      - uses [[file:sprites-framework.rkt][sprites-framework.rkt]]
- [[file:sprites-universe-server.rkt][sprites-universe-server.rkt]] - welcomes new worlds, relays messages
      - uses [[file:sprites-framework.rkt][sprites-framework.rkt]]
- [[file:sprites-worlds-client-test.rkt][sprites-worlds-client-test.rkt]] - tests the frameworks
      - uses [[file:sprites-framework.rkt][sprites-framework.rkt]]
      - uses [[file:sprites-client-framework.rkt][sprites-client-framework.rkt]]

Game program
- implemented as a World (Client) Application
- uses [[file:sprites-client-framework.rkt][sprites-client-framework.rkt]]
- exchanges messages with [[file:sprites-universe-server.rkt][sprites-universe-server.rkt]]

** Future Desires

Replace universe package with
- Something which uses Racket Serialization
- Something more like Croquet

Replace Images package with
- SVG wrapper with all functionality of
      - 2htdp/images
      - pict
      - metapict
      - Racket Drawing library
      - any other existing Racket 2D Drawing systems
      - functional model
      - constraint-logic model
            - Racket constraint package --> set of logic variables
            - logic variables override regular Racket variables
- Roughly
      - Pict -> functional SVG wrapper + constraint-logic
      - Pict3D -> functional X3D wrapper +  constraint-logic
